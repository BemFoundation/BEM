# Introduction
 In this paper BEMT token is explained along with its founding goals, technical 
specifications, terminologies and future plans.
## BEM Foundation
The Best Economic Money Foundation

The BEM Foundation is made up of experts in the field of Cryptocurrency, Programming and 

Marketing. Each of these individuals has several years of work experience in defined fields.

The identities of these individuals will not be revealed based on the principles and spirit of 

decentralization, Blockchain and raising the security level of projects.

The BEM Foundation was formed with the goal of Entrepreneurship on the Blockchain and 

its global development.

## Blockchain

A blockchain will allow the data held in that database to be spread out among several 
network nodes at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but also maintains the 
fidelity of the data stored therein, for example, if somebody (a node) tries to alter a record 
at one instance of the database, the other nodes would not be altered and so would prevent 
a bad actor from doing so. 
Also, the bad actor with incorrect data will easily be pinpointed and remedies to prevent 
malevolent actions will be placed. This system helps to establish an exact and transparent 
order of events. This way, no one node within the network can alter information held within 
it.
In a blockchain, the record could be a list of transactions (such as with a cryptocurrency), 
but it also is possible for a blockchain to hold a variety of other information like legal 
contracts, state identifications, or a company’s product inventory which makes it possible to 
implement lots of innovative ideas upon this technology.
## POA – Proof of Authority
BEMPIRE uses a POA consensus algorithm. The term POA or Proof of Authority was coined 
in 2017 by Gavin wood the co-founder of Ethereum and Parity Technologies. The POA 
consensus allows the blockchain to have high-speed transactions and a low cost.
In blockchain platforms, consensus about the validity of a transaction or data could be 
reached with a different kind of mechanism. POA is an algorithm used in blockchains as a 
permissioned consensus mechanism which unlike, permissionless blockchains where 
anyone can become a node, in permissioned blockchain all nodes are pre-selected. This 
allows having consensus with high scalability and bandwidth. In addition to fast transaction 
speed and affordability, the POA is very secure against DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) 
attack and also 51% attack.

## Smart Contract

Smart contracts are computer programs that are hosted and executed on blockchain 
networks. Each smart contract contains a code that specifies a predetermined condition that, 
if fulfilled, will yield predefined results. By running on a decentralized blockchain instead of 
a centralized server, smart contracts allow multiple parties to reach a common shared result 
accurately, in a timely manner and without manipulation.
Smart contracts are a powerful infrastructure for automation because they are not 
controlled by a central administrator and are not vulnerable to attacks by malicious entities 
from a single point. When applied to multilateral digital contracts, smart contract 
applications can reduce counterparty risk, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and provide new 
levels of process transparency.

# BEM Token (BEMT)

BEMT is a utility token from BEM Foundation; it can be used to get membership and 
discounts for BEM Foundation services. Holders of BEMT can also swap it for BEM coin the 
main cryptocurrency of BEM foundation dedicated Blockchain, BEMPIRE, through a BEMT 
bridge contract that will be explained further in this paper.

## Goals of the BEM

BEMT is the first executive program of the BEM Foundation. BEMT is very important for the 
foundation. Because everyone knows the foundation by BEMT. 
BEMT has been used in entrepreneurship programs. And has played an important role. All 
projects start with BEMT. Projects are financed through BEMT. BEMT will be the first official 
BEM Blockchain token. And will be transferred to the BEM Blockchain through the bridge 
contract.

## Why BEMT?

Because the BEM Foundation has great plans for the future of BEMT. BEMT has more uses 
every day, which attracts more holders and traders. The BEM Foundation uses various 
marketing schemes to develop the BEMT market, which will ensure price growth. BEMT will 
eventually move to its Blockchain, which will lead to a price increase.
The limited number of BEMTs and its many projects will soon make holding of even 
0.000001 BEMT in your account worthwhile.
The value of most currencies rises only through demand, supply, sales and purchase by 
holders and investors. The use of these currencies and their programs is mostly limited to 
ideas or need a lot of time for execution and implementation. By mere ownership of an idea, 
they distribute the currency among people and raise its price.
However, other than being sold, purchased and held by holders like all other currencies that 
naturally gives it more value, BEMT may also be used at present time, that is inside the career 
platforms where people can only participate by BEMT.
The unlimited r plans follow the rules of progression, as the sales organization of the 
platforms grows so does the demand for BEMT, and this goes on until the 6th decimal digit of 
the token is made valuable. Participants in BEM platforms gain BEMTs by working in the 
projects, and at the same time raise the dollar value of their BEMTs.

## BEM Blockchain 
 
The name of the BEM Blockchain is a combination of two words. BEM stands for (Best 
Economic Money) and the name of the Blockchain (BEM + EMPIRE = BEMPIRE).
The Best Economic Money Empire Blockchain = BEMPIRE Blockchain
BEMPIRE is the key step in the BEM foundation’s roadmap of entrepreneurial investments. 
The BEMPIRE is a Blockchain that enables decentralized applications and stores 
transactions. BEMPIRE as a Blockchain will guarantee the fidelity and security of the records 
and data, also provides trust without the need for a trusted third party.
 
## BEMPIRE 
 
BEMPIRE is the BEM foundation’s dedicated blockchain. BEMPIRE enables high-speed 
transactions speed with low cost. BEMPIRE boasts the latest technologies and the possibility 
to implement DAPPS, smart contracts, DEFI Project, Stable coins, Tokens, decentralized 
games, NFTs, NFT market, Wallet, SWAP, DEX, etc.
BEMPIRE is fully compatible with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) programs so you can use 
and improve your old Solidity codes easily in BEM foundation’s dedicated blockchain. 
BEMPIRE provides a great and easy infrastructure for creators and developers to quickly 
implement their own contracts, tokens, DAPPS, etc.
The usage of the latest blockchain technologies in BEMPIRE makes it a really fast platform 
and together with its very low cost of transaction and program implementation, creators and 
developers can quickly build their own apps and even more quickly generate a decent 
income
Here are some basic specifications of BEMPIRE blockchain:
 At the launch time, BEMPIRE in addition to its main server will have four validators 
and these validators can be increased in the future.
 Blocks are created every 4 seconds and two BEM (the official coin of BEMPIRE) will 
be rewarded to validators.
 There will be a private sale before the launch.
 BEM (the official coin of BEMPIRE) firstly will have a private sale and then ICO in 
some of the major exchanges to be publicly tradable.
 There will be total of 100.000.000 (One hundred million) of pre-minted BEM at the 
launch time of BEMPIRE which it seems from early internal negotiations no more than 
20% of these coins will be offered publicly.

More info about the tokenomics of BEMPIRE including the ICO amount and time, amount of 
monthly coin burns, Airdrop program, creators share and etc. will be revealed with the 
official unveiling of the BEMPIRE and its whitepaper.
BEMPIRE official site and its blockchain explorer are going to be launch in upcoming days. 
There is also an unveiling for a grid website, which provides necessary information for 
creators and developers.
Finally yet importantly, with the launch of BEMPIRE, simultaneously official BEM 
foundation’s SWAP and Stable Coin will be released. In addition, BEMT and BCN tokens 
together with the BemChain project all will migrate to BEMPIRE blockchain.

## BEMT Bridge Contract 
 
The BEMT bridge contract is for the transfer of BEMT TRC20 to the BEMPIRE Blockchain.
In this contract, the performance is such that it automatically burns with the transfer of 
BEMT TRC20 and In BEMPIRE Blockchain, the same number of BEMTs are produced and 
sent.
After the completion of the transfer project, the new BEMT can be traded in the same 
exchanges listed and in BEM Swap.
This contract also includes the Staking section:
Investors freeze BEMT TRC20 and in return, they are paid BEM Coin by Mining Validators. 
In the Staking section, BEMT TRC20 are burned and the BEM Coin is mined for them along 
with the profit.

## Cooperation with BEM Foundation: 
People with big attractive entrepreneurship ideas and the will to develop and expand their 
startups in blockchain space will find that BEM Foundation provides the infrastructures 
required for their activities.
Drawing up the smart contracts of those startups and providing the funds for executing them 
are among the services provided by the foundation. 
Ideas generally being with a special kind of idealism and face development challenges on 
their path. BEM Foundation does no care how simple an idea might seem because it creates 
the development path for each idea. In the blockchain space a goal may be executed all over 
the world at any moment. 
BEM Foundation makes and connects a chain of these ideas, creating a community of 
presented ideas and a community of potential demands. 
At the start of each business in the BEM system, BEM Foundation will develop the required 
infrastructure and provide it to the potential applicants. Each holder in the BEM system may 
turn into an idea creator and start his/her own business in the blockchain space, and at the 
same time that holder may follow his/her needs in BEM platforms.
The presentation of the business or ideas of a holder in the BEM system is a sign of its 
reliability. Development, execution or provision of the infrastructures for that business is the 
specialty of BEM Foundation.
### Note 1: 
Projects will be analyzed before execution to prevent financial losses to people or their use 
for negative intents and projects, and the financial capacities of applicants are thoroughly 
reviewed. 
The BEMT token will be used in such projects, which stands as an index to project safety and 
guarantee for its survival.
### Note 2: 
All ideas and projects submitted to the R&D team are kept confidential, never been disclosed 
or copied.
