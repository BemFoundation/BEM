# Introduction
 In this paper BEMT token is explained along with its founding goals, technical 
specifications, terminologies and future plans.
## BEM Foundation    
The Best Economic Money Foundation

The BEM Foundation is made up of experts in the field of Cryptocurrency, Programming and 

Marketing. Each of these individuals has several years of work experience in defined fields.

The identities of these individuals will not be revealed based on the principles and spirit of 

decentralization, Blockchain and raising the security level of projects.

The BEM Foundation was formed with the goal of Entrepreneurship on the Blockchain and 

its global development.

## Blockchain
BEMT stands for ‘Best Economic Money Token’.
BEMT is a token that was launched on the Tron [Blockchain](https://tronscan.io/#/). BEMT is a  token. BEMT has inherited all features of TRX, its most remarkable ones being high transaction speed and low transaction costs.
Total Supply : 30,000,000
BEMT has 6 decimal digits like TRX.
Blockchain Explorer : [tronscan.io](tronscan.io)

BEMT Release Date in November 8, 2020 .
The BEM Foundation has considered 2 time periods for distribution of BEMT tokens in the markets. Advance Sales: 20 days It starts at 12:00 GMT on November 8, 2020 and lasts until 12:00 GMT on November 27, 2020. 

## Blockchain

A blockchain will allow the data held in that database to be spread out among several 
network nodes at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but also maintains the 
fidelity of the data stored therein, for example, if somebody (a node) tries to alter a record 
at one instance of the database, the other nodes would not be altered and so would prevent 
a bad actor from doing so. 
Also, the bad actor with incorrect data will easily be pinpointed and remedies to prevent 
malevolent actions will be placed. This system helps to establish an exact and transparent 
order of events. This way, no one node within the network can alter information held within 
it.
In a blockchain, the record could be a list of transactions (such as with a cryptocurrency), 
but it also is possible for a blockchain to hold a variety of other information like legal 
contracts, state identifications, or a company’s product inventory which makes it possible to 
implement lots of innovative ideas upon this technology.
## POA – Proof of Authority
BEMPIRE uses a POA consensus algorithm. The term POA or Proof of Authority was coined 
in 2017 by Gavin wood the co-founder of Ethereum and Parity Technologies. The POA 
consensus allows the blockchain to have high-speed transactions and a low cost.
In blockchain platforms, consensus about the validity of a transaction or data could be 
reached with a different kind of mechanism. POA is an algorithm used in blockchains as a 
permissioned consensus mechanism which unlike, permissionless blockchains where 
anyone can become a node, in permissioned blockchain all nodes are pre-selected. This 
allows having consensus with high scalability and bandwidth. In addition to fast transaction 
speed and affordability, the POA is very secure against DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) 
attack and also 51% attack.

## Smart Contract

Smart contracts are computer programs that are hosted and executed on blockchain 
networks. Each smart contract contains a code that specifies a predetermined condition that, 
if fulfilled, will yield predefined results. By running on a decentralized blockchain instead of 
a centralized server, smart contracts allow multiple parties to reach a common shared result 
accurately, in a timely manner and without manipulation.
Smart contracts are a powerful infrastructure for automation because they are not 
controlled by a central administrator and are not vulnerable to attacks by malicious entities 
from a single point. When applied to multilateral digital contracts, smart contract 
applications can reduce counterparty risk, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and provide new 
levels of process transparency.

# Future Plans BEMT
### Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform:
BEM Foundation is always on the look to identify and foresee the great opportunities for entrepreneurship and creation of developing employment fields. Another program of BEM Foundation is to create a crypto exchange with the goal of offering its customers all around the world digital assets transaction services according to relevant rules. The created exchange with easy access and low transaction charges will support most blockchain coins and tokens. The exchange alone shall serve as a space for online deals and making money. This type of activity is also very good for the main goal of BEM Foundation, i.e. creation of suitable occupational spaces.
### On-Chain Gaming: 
BEM Foundation foresees that blockchain technology is capable of revolutionizing the online gambling industry, and the players should of course be provided with a safe and transparent environment.BEM Foundation intends to solve challenges such as low transmission speed in games, game result manipulations, and delays in payment of money, and to create games with high graphics and attraction inside the blockchain space by BEMT token.
BEM Foundation might also participate in programs such as liquidity, online casino, video sharing portal, decentralized lending, etc.

# Vision 
The main goal of BEM Foundation is to create a private BEM blockchain. This blockchain shall handle the writing of smart contracts in view of the needs of games and entrepreneurship programs. Each group of projects shall have their own private tokens or coins.
This private blockchain is aimed as facilitating the creation of network marketing projects, so that the regular network marketing sites in various countries can use the BEM blockchain and all concerns for quick and consistent commission payments and banking relations are totally tackled and solved according to laws of each country. 
Companies will be able to use the smart contracts of BEM blockchain to go multinational and expand their sales networks into various countries. 
Once the BEM blockchain is created, all tokens made in other blockchains will be swapped to BEM blockchain itself. Each BEMT will be swapped to a BEMC (Best Economic Money Coin).
